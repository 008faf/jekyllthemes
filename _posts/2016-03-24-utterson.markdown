Utterson was built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and  [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a vanilla Jekyll install. It was designed and developed by [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano), to provide a minimal and unassuming theme, focused on what matters: you and your content.

[See the theme in action](http://utterson.alidcastano.com/).

* **Scrolling navigation bar** for posts lets readers can easily go back to your home page. 
* **Fade-in footer** allows you to have one last call to action at the bottom of each post, without getting in the way of your content. 

Also, building off Poole's vanilla install:

* **Easily scalable** text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS.
* **Mobile Friendly Design** so that your site can be accessed on any device.
